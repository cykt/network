"""Week 3 · Task 1 — Build your own iterative resolver.

Textbook §2.4.2 - §2.4.3.

`dig +trace` walks root -> TLD -> authoritative for you. In this task you do
that walk yourself: start at a root server, read the delegation it returns,
ask the next server, and keep going until somebody answers authoritatively.

You may shell out to `dig` for the transport, or use a DNS library
(`dnspython` is in the container). Either is fine - what matters is that
*you* follow the delegations rather than letting a tool do it.

    python3 task1_resolve.py www.korea.ac.kr
    python3 task1_resolve.py --verify        # check yourself against dig

Pass condition
--------------
`--verify` resolves five names with your resolver and with `dig`, and the
addresses must agree. A name behind a CDN may legitimately return a different
address each time; the harness compares the *set of authoritative nameservers*
you ended at for those, not the address.

    The whole point is that you never ask a server to recurse for you.
    You ask one server, it says "not mine, ask over there", and you go there.

    Suggested shape - but it is yours to design:

        resolve(name) -> (address, path)
            address : the A record you ended up with, as a string
            path    : the servers you asked, in order, so you can show your work

    Things you will hit, in roughly this order:

    1.  A delegation gives you NS *names*, sometimes with glue A records and
        sometimes without. No glue means you have to resolve that nameserver's
        name first - which is another walk. Decide what you do there.
    2.  A server may not answer. Try the next one rather than giving up.
    3.  CNAMEs. The answer you get back may be a different name than the one
        you asked for, and you have to start again with that name.
    4.  Loops. Cap your depth.

    If you shell out to dig, the flag you want is `+norecurse`, so that the
    server you ask replies with a delegation instead of doing the work:

        dig @198.41.0.4 www.korea.ac.kr +norecurse
